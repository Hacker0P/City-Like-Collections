# Deployment Instructions

Great news! Your code is fully updated and pushed to GitHub.

## 🚀 How to Deploy on Netlify (Recommended)

1.  **Log in to Netlify:**
    Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com) and log in.

2.  **Add New Site:**
    Click **"Add new site"** -> **"Import an existing project"**.

3.  **Connect to GitHub:**
    -   Click the **GitHub** button.
    -   Authorize Netlify if asked.
    -   Search for and select your repository: `Hacker0P/City-Like-Collections`.

4.  **Configure Build (Defaults are usually correct):**
    -   **Base directory:** (leave empty)
    -   **Build command:** `npm run build`
    -   **Publish directory:** `dist`

5.  **Deploy:**
    Click **"Deploy Site"**.

## ✅ That's it!
Netlify will build your site and give you a live URL (e.g., `city-like-collection.netlify.app`).
Any future changes you push to GitHub will automatically redeploy the live site.
